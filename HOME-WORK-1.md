# Part 1, Overview and Origin

**\* Name of company** -Wirex Limited.

**\* When was the company incorporated?** - It was

founded in 2014 and is based in London, England.


**\* Who are the founders of the company?** - [Dmitry Lazarichev](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dmitry-lazarichev "Dmitry Lazarichev"),[ Georgy Sokolov](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/georgy-sokolov "Georgy Sokolov"),[ Pavel Matveev](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/pavel-matveev "Pavel Matveev")

\* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? - Wirex is a digital payment platform that aims to make crypto and traditional currencies equal and accessible to everyone. It makes fintech simple. Its mobile app and Wirex card allows its users to buy, store, exchange, and spend a wide variety of conventional and digital currencies quickly and securely, with no hidden fees and zero fuss.

**\* How is the company funded?** - SBI Holdings is an economic service commercial enterprise company that offers financial products and associated services information.

**\* How much funding have they received?** -  $22.9 million

# Part 2, Business Activities:

**\* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?** - In my opinion, the company performs a very important task by combining traditional banking services with blockchain technologies and support for a large number of cryptocurrencies, while creating a maximally simple and user-friendly interface for the user. Thus, almost anyone with a smartphone can use the application and receive, transfer and spend money quickly and with minimal commissions, which is very important in the modern world. The company also gives cashback on all purchases made on its card in the amount of 4%, which looks very attractive, it is also possible to place deposits with a rate of up to 16% per annum.

**\* Who is the company's intended customer?** -  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? - A potential client is anyone who has a smartphone, and the most basic understanding about cryptocurrencies. Given the fact that financial literacy of people around the world is growing with the development of technology, and cryptocurrencies are increasingly entering our lives and slowly beginning to inspire confidence in people, I think Wirex and similar companies will soon push traditional financial institutions out of the market

**\* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?** - (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) - 4% cashback instantly from the amount spent on the card. Similar conditions are offered Crypto.com but there you need to open a deposit for a significant amount to get access to such cashback

**\* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** - (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stack share to find this information.) Wirex, uses their own token-WXT. WXT is built on both the Stellar Network and Ethereum blockchain for maximum speed, efficiency and flexibility.
# Part 3 Landscape

**\*What domain of the financial industry is the company in?** - Wirex is an innovative app and payment card that allows users to seamlessly send, receive, exchange and spend a range of digital and conventional currencies. Through the Wire x platform, users can make payments via its Wirex App and payment card, which support the spending of digital and conventional currencies.

**\* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?** - In my opinion, the field of digital assets is growing very fast. 10 years ago, cryptocurrencies were considered fraud.   5 years ago, few people heard about bitcoin. Today, almost every person between the ages of 6 and at least 65 has heard about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Also, according to statistics for 2021, about three hundred million people use cryptocurrencies. This is about 4% of the world's population. I think this figure will grow at least 5 times or more over the next 10 years

**\* What are the other major companies in this domain?** – Binance; Crypto.com; Coinjar; Revolute; Amon;

# ` `Part 5 Recommendations

**\* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? -** (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

The first thing I would pay attention to is the development of cross technologies in the blockchain. This is a very big and very important problem in my opinion. So that you can transfer money in different networks while moving from network to network inside the same wallet. The second is to add the ability to link the card to a smartphone for contactless payment. Now we have to carry plastic everywhere with us. Which is very strange considering the year 2022 is outside the window. Competitors, such as Coinjar, have such that option.

**\* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? -** The more intuitive, convenient and simpler the interface, the more people want to use it. For this, at one time, everyone loved the iPhone

**\* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize -** Near-field communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless connectivity technology that uses magnetic field induction to enable communication between devices when they're touched together or brought within a few centimeters of each other.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? -** This is the most effective and widespread technology for paying with a smartphone using card details today.
